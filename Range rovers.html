<h3>My favourite Range Rover</h3>
<p>My favourite range rover is the range rover velar. The Velar is known for its luzury and its own type of coupe suv look. The fastest range rover velar is the Land rover range rover SVAutobiogreaph dinamic edetion. While the normal range rover with all its kit on it costs about £77,500, the range rover SVAutobiography with all the kit can cost a near £100,000. The SVAutobiography reaches 0-60mph in 3.8-4.3 which is about as fast as a BMW saloon car. This range rover has a top speed if 170mph which is very impressive for a two ton suv. This coupe suv is undoughtly the most luxurious and fastest suv on the market. There is one problem with this car and that is reliability. Range rover is not known for its reliability. The SVAutobiography has 550hrp, 502pt and has a towing copasity of two tons. Like any range rover it can go offroading. It is on air suspention which can be right on the floor or 8 inches high. There is one more thing. The is car has quad exhaaust pipes which makes it sound like a saloun car too. You may be asking what on earth are you going to do with 550hrp. Well this may be a first for you because this car, like a saloon, can do drifting. That is when you disingage the traction control and send all the power to the rear. Just don't over do it. Remember you are driving a two ton suv. This model also comes with a paramadic sun roof and has 3.0l engine with a wadeing depth of 2f-3f. When you do get your range rover, you will probably notice there aren't any others on the road. This is because again of reliability. This car is the least reliable car in the world but people still get them, probably for its luxury. Maybe in the future range rover will change their engine and become more reliable and luxurious. Only the future will tell.</p>
